INTRODUCTION
             A running bar chart, also known as an animated or dynamic bar chart, typically shows the progression or comparison of values over time. It 

dynamically updates to show how the data changes, often used to represent rankings, trends, or time-based statistics.

STEPS
      There are few major steps undertaken for the creation of Running bar graph 

step 1: collect the required data through web scrapping method or in other available websites or webpages.

        I used flourish to create running bar graph

step 2: Start a New Visualization

Once logged in, click on the New visualization button from your dashboard as per ur need.

step 3: Choose the Right Template

Scroll through the available templates or type "Bar chart race" in the search bar.

Select the Bar chart race template. This template is specifically designed for running bar charts, where bars represent changes over time.

step 4: Upload or Enter Your Data

You'll be taken to a screen with an option to upload data or edit the sample data.

Click on the Data tab at the top to upload your dataset, or copy and paste your data into the spreadsheet editor.

The data needs to be in a specific format for the running bar chart:

Rows: Each row represents a data point for a specific time period.

Columns: One column for the time (e.g., years or dates), one for the categories (e.g., names of companies or products), and one for the values (e.g., sales figures or rankings).

step 5: Customize the Chart

After uploading your data, Flourish will automatically create a running bar chart based on your template choice.

You can customize the look and feel of the chart by going to the Preview tab. There, you can adjust:

Bar colors: Customize colors for different categories.

Duration of each step: How fast the bars animate.

Labels and titles: Edit the titles, captions, or axis labels.

Order and rank: Configure how the categories are ranked over time.

step 6: Refine Data Mapping

Go to the Data tab and make sure the data is mapped correctly:

Time: Ensure the correct column is selected for the time variable (e.g., Year).

Category: Select the correct column for your categories (e.g., Country or Product).

Values: Choose the column for the values that will determine the bar lengths.

step 7: Preview and Adjust

Check how your running bar chart looks in the Preview tab.

If needed, go back to the Settings or Data tabs to make adjustments, such as reordering bars, changing colors, or adjusting the speed of the animation.

I have followed the above mentioned steps and created a running animated bar chart for car sales over time in each company in india and analysed the major car sales company.
